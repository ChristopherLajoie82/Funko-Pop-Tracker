##Funko Pop Tracker Program

#Overview

The Funko Pop Tracker Program is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to help users manage and track their Funko Pop collection. This program allows users to add new Funko Pop figures, view the entire collection, and remove figures they no longer own. The application also calculates the total number and value of the collection.

#Features

Add Funko Pop: Users can add new Funko Pop figures by providing the name, collection, and price.

View Collection Information: Displays all Funko Pop figures in the collection, sorted alphabetically, along with their details such as name, collection, and price. Also shows the total number of Funko Pops and the total value of the collection.

Remove Funko Pop: Allows users to remove a Funko Pop from the collection by selecting it from the displayed list.

#Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

Tkinter: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface.

JSON: File format used to store the Funko Pop collection data locally.

#How It Works

The Funko Pop Tracker saves the collection to a JSON file (funko_collection.json). This ensures that the collection information persists even after the program is closed.

Users can interact with the program via a simple and intuitive GUI, with options to add, view, and remove Funko Pops.

#Usage

Add Funko Pop: Click on the "Add Funko Pop" button, enter the required details (name, collection, price), and click "Add".

View Collection Information: Click on the "Collection Information" button to view all saved Funko Pop details, the total number of items, and the total value.

Remove Funko Pop: Click on the "Remove Funko Pop" button, view the current collection, and enter the number of the Funko Pop you want to remove.

Exit: Click the "Exit" button to close the program.
